**Meetings/Workshops**
* The PyHC Fall 2023 AGU session received 18 abstracts, and was placed as a poster session at AGU 2023.
    * Session conveners: Julie Barnum, Shawn Polson, Angeline Burrell, Arnaud Masson
    * Session SH012: Implementations in Python for Solar and Space Physics
    * We accepted all abstracts, ordered them such that posters of similar topics are grouped, and decided chairs, OSPA liaison, etc.
* PyHC 2024 summer school
    * A few bi-weekly planning meetings have occurred where we’ve decided upon dates, times, location, as well as created a rough draft of the schedule. We intend to finalize this schedule by the end of September 2023 when everyone is back from annual leaves and vacations. At that point, we will begin marketing the summer school to folks.
    * Date/time/location: May 20-24, 2024 for the summer school, to take place online and in-person at LASP in Boulder, CO.
* Inaugural DASH workshop
    * Julie has continued participating as an organizer for this effort as part of the role as PyHC lead, and applied for/was awarded an NSF travel funding grant to provide selected attendees with a travel stipend.
* GDC Science Team Meeting (July 2023)
    * Doug Rowland arranged for NASA to send Julie out as a visiting scientist to NASA GSFC. She presented on PyHC and began creating collaborations and frameworks for integrating GDC software creation efforts into PyHC (and vice versa).
* Other
    * Submitted abstracts: LASP leadership submitted abstracts to DASH 2023, as well as other conferences (4th Eddy Cross-Disciplinary Symposium, ADASS 2023, AGU, AMS)
    * Meetings: several tag-ups with community members to ideate on PyHC future activities, potential new workshops, and overall PyHC improvement, as well as Julie regularly attending Ryan McGranaghan’s Helio Open Science Infrastructure tag-ups (related to PyHC leadership activities).
 
**Telecons/Website Updates** 
* We continued to hold biweekly telecons as schedules allowed. 
    * Topics included: relevant discussions (pyOpenSci and PyHC connection, PyHC Standards re-visit, updates on Shawn Polson’s PyHC gallery restructure, and PyHC possible package tiering restructuring), as well as presentations to the community (GDC science overview, DKIST data and Python tools, Equitable Letters for Space Physics (ELSP) overview, and PlasmaPy GitHub Actions and Sphinx updates).
* PyHC website updates: 
    * Added PyGS to the PyHC packages (overview to come in a later telecon).
    * Miscellaneous: added old quarterly status reports to our documents page.
